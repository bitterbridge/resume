## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why?

I dislike WYSIWYG editors and I should customize my résumé for each job application. I've been fighting with computers for like thirty years at this point, and I have a lot of skill and experience, but most of that will not be applicable to any given job description. So, basically, I want to create a tunable résumé.

And also because I don't know LaTeX, and I thought I might as well add something new to my résumé.

### How's It Going, Nug Doug?

Not well, Other Nug Doug. Not well.
