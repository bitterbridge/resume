I’m looking for a role that blends systems thinking, creative autonomy, and technical depth — ideally at the intersection of
machine learning, simulation, and infrastructure. I thrive in environments that value elegance, exploration, and play, where
weirdness is a feature, not a bug. I want to expand the frontiers of science, benefit humanity, and blow minds.
